This is a simple XOR example.

To run and verify the results type:
make
sh TEST.sh

You should see the pred and known outputs agree to high precision.

You can modify TEST.sh to increase the training set size and add noise.

We also include a jupyter notebook 'xor.ipynb' that shows how to build and run. It
also include the surface demonstration from "How Neural Networks Work". Citation:
