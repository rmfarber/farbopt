farbopt
=======

A TF/s to PF/s numerical optimization and machine-learning framework as discussed in my Dr. Dobbs and techEnablement.com tutorials. 

This is a development version 

To build the necessary libs (e.g. nlopt and adolc) run the following script.
run sh BUILD_LIBS.sh

After that, cd to either src_CUDA or src_OMP and copy the example(s) you want to the directory.

cp -r ../examples/* .

cd to a directory and read the README or type make. Exanine the RUN script
to see if the number if examples is the right size then type sh RUN.
